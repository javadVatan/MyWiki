https://programs.wiki/wiki/obtain-the-image-of-usb-external-camera-based-on-android-device.html

Uvvccamera open source project
There are 8 routines (from easy to difficult), which need to reference the author's own libuvccamera library, which is of reference value. ( https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera)

Open source project of blogger Xiaochi's notes
For the "Xiaochi hee hee" project of the simplified Book blogger, the article of the Xiaochi blogger should be read carefully. It also uses the libuvccamera Library above, but it uses AIDL, which can't be understood by novices like me. (cover your face)( https://github.com/yorkZJC/UvcCameraDemo)

Open source project of blogger jiangdongguo
This requires the introduction of the blogger's own libuvccamera library. You can't use the library of the original author of uvvccamera. Write the program according to his demo. You can realize the preview of USB camera in your own project. ( GitHub source address: https://github.com/jiangdongguo/AndroidUSBCamera)

Finally, this paper refers to the open source project of blogger jiangdongguo and is completed under the guidance of blogger's anonymous FTER article. ( https://blog.csdn.net/andrexpert/article/details/78324181)
